 KNN Algorithm on Cancer data set

KNN which stand for K Nearest Neighbor is a 
Supervised Machine Learning algorithm
that classifies a new data point into the target class, 
depending on the features of its neighboring data points.  

From the given cancer data set we should do normalize
to get  two points apply to the data frame , 
then we should train 80% and test remaining 20% for 
training and evaluating model performance 
we should install "CLASS" Package we want to improve still 
so by  gmodels its tools for model fitting then prediction 
the model once again test and train by using gmodel
